# oidc-op
Examples of a OIDC OPs with CherryPy, Flask and Django.
**NOT** something you should even image running in a production environment.

This project are here to show you how to 'build' an OP using the
classes and functions provided by oidc-op.

If you are just going to build a standard OP you only have to write the
configuration file. If you want to add or replace functionality please read the [Official Documentation](#TODO).
